### Instructions for Running the Code

#### 1. Install Dependencies
Before running the script, ensure you have all required libraries installed. If you haven't installed them yet, you can do so using the `requirements.txt` file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 2. Import Required Libraries
The script relies on the following libraries:
- `pandas` for data handling
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations
- `plotly` for interactive charts
- `geopandas` and `geopy` for geographical data processing

#### 3. Run the Script
Once the dependencies are installed, run the script in your preferred Python environment (Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, PyCharm, etc.).

```
python script_name.py
```

#### 4. Expected Outputs
- **Data Processing**: The script loads and processes data using `pandas` and `numpy`.
- **Visualizations**: Generates different types of graphs and charts using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Uses `geopandas` and `geopy` to process and visualize geographical data.

#### 5. Troubleshooting
- If you encounter missing packages, manually install them using:
  ```
  pip install package_name
  ```
- Ensure your Python version is 3.7 or later.
